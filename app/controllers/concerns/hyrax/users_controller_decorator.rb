      # The #find_user method is a :before_action on the Hyrax::UsersController. It sets
      # the @user variable, which we need in this method.
      #
      # However, because we are decorating Hyrax::UsersController with this module,
      # this method's :before_action will fire before the one that calls #find_user.
      # This means that #find_user will fire a second time after this method runs.
      #
      # This is not ideal, but after discussing with @jeremyf, we decided that this is
      # the "lesser evil" compared to other override methods (i.e. using #class_eval,
      # overriding the entire file, etc.); since User is an ActiveRecord object, the
      # database query that sets @user in #find_user will be cached.
      #
      # Classes that inherit from Hyrax::UsersController do not have this problem
      # (e.g. Hyrax::Dashboard::ProfilesController), which is why we check for presence.
