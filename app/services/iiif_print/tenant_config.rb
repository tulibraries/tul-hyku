module IiifPrint
  ##
  # This module encapsulates the logic for whether or not we'll use the IIIF Print services for the
  # current tenant/account.  The IIIF Print services does the following:
  #
  # - Skipping IIIF Print based derivative generation
  # - Skipping PDF Splitting
  # - Ignoring showing PDFs in the UV
  #
  # @note I am specifically isolating as much of this code into one module as possible, so that it
  #       it is hopefully easier to understand the configuration requirements and scope to this
  #       change.  At some point, this might make sense to bring into IIIF Print directly.
